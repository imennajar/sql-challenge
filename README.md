# sql-challenge


In this project, we will see how to use SQL stands for Structured Query Language to create  .
In this project, we will see in the first part what the weather is like as we approach the equator, and in the second part how to plan future vacations using weather data skills.


## What we will learn from this project:

- How to generate the Cities List by Using the citipy Library
  
- How to use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated
  
- How Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code
  
- How to use our skill to create Plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and Latitude: Latitude vs. Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed.
  
- How to use our skills to compute Linear Regression for each relationship: Latitude vs. Temperature in Northern and Southern Hemisphere, Latitude vs. Humidity in Northern and Southern Hemisphere,
  Latitude vs. Cloudiness in Northern and Southern Hemisphere, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed in Northern and Southern Hemisphere.  We will include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the rvalues.
  
- How to create a map that displays a point for every city of our data using a characteristic of the weather
  
- How to narrow down our data to find our ideal weather condition
  
- How to use the Geoapify API to find hotels (or any other location)
  
- How to add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map
  
## Instructions:

- Prepare the data

- Retrieve weather data

- Create Plots

- Compute Linear Regression Plots

- Create Maps

## Program:

### Tools:

- PostgreSQL: (usually referred to as "Postgres") is an  object-relational database management system that uses the SQL language.üêò

- pgAdmin: is the management tool used for working with Postgres. It simplifies creation, maintenance, and use of database objects.
  
- QuickDBD: is a web-based application that can be used to design and model databases.


### Code 
### Data Modeling
Inspecting the CSV files and sketching an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD




#### Create tables of the database

### Retrieve data

## Tip:ü™Ñ

For a better analysis of the relationship between weather variables and Latitude, we can create maps that display, for example in the Southern Hemisphere, a point for each city in our data. The size of the point will represent weather variables in each map.
